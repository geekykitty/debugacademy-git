# 'Story-merge' with Git
We will play a game similar to "Mad Libs" using Git. In this game, each player will complete **only ONE** sentence below before committing and pushing their work. Creative and/or silly responses are welcome.  

**Only fill in ONE section below; the rest will be filled in by other team players.**  

## Introduction  
To come up with an awesome activity for the team to play. This activity will either be fun for all, none, or most. I should hope that the odds will forever be in your favour while participating in this activity. Live long and prosper my fellow git hubbers. :-)
